### Where can I see a live demo?

As FDM is a real company i cannot host a live demo of the application however screenshots are Provided above.

<br />

### What was my experience? <br />

In a software engineering module I took, I was given a problem by a real company (FDM) and had to create a software solution for expense claims. From the problem definition I created user stories, from the user stories I was able to do the UX and creating user flows and the UI design including colour themes and ensuring accessibility.

After that I began prototyping and created an application. After reviewing the application with the FDM clients I got feedback, from the feedback I was able to plan, design then further implement the features asked for. After all user stories were complete, I went further and added extra features that Imagined would benefit the users such as forgot password, currency convertor, multi-language support and light/dark mode.

<br />
